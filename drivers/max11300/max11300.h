/**
 @brief MAX11300 - PIXI, 20-Port Programmable Mixed-Signal I/O with
 12-Bit ADC, 12-Bit DAC, Analog Switches, and GPIO

 The MAX11300 integrates a PIXIâ„¢, 12-bit, multichannel, analog-to-digital
 converter (ADC) and a 12-bit, multichannel, buffered digital-to-analog
 converter (DAC) in a single integrated circuit (IC). This device offers
 20 mixed-signal high-voltage, bipolar ports, which are configurable as an
 ADC analog input, a DAC analog output, a general-purpose input port (GPI),
 a general-purpose output port (GPO), or an analog switch terminal.
 One internal and two external temperature sensors track junction and
 environmental temperature, respectively. Adjacent pairs of ports are
 configurable as a logic-level translator for open-drain devices or an
 analog switch.

 https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/data-converters/analog-to-digital-converters/MAX11300.html/tb_tab2
 to generate MAX11300hex.h file
